 ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Thomas Kwashnak. I'm a Bachelor of Arts Computer Science undergraduate at Quinnipiac University with a double minor in Economics and Data Science.
 
 Much of my current work on here is either side-projects or projects related to my courses. The longest-going side project is the paceManager repository (java), which I have been working on from time to time as I learn best practices and improve the structure of the program for future use.
