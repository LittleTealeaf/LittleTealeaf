### Hello There! I'm Thomas Kwashnak

- Undergraduate Student at Quinnipiac University studying Computer Science and Data Science, with a minor in economics.
- Not currently looking for a job, but wide open for internship opportunities for Summer 2023
- I'm an "anything-but-apple" enthusiast. Doesn't mean I completely dispise apple, just means I personally prefer other companies.
